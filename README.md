# Zoning for Autonomous Vehicles

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of zav (Zoning for Autonomous Vehicles) is to show the
implementation of the problem instance generation and simulation
experiment conducted for the project.

## Installation

You can install the development version of zav from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
# note that there is a GitHub only dependency
# devtools::install_github("cuhklinlab/SWKM")
devtools::install_github("Rosenkrands/zav")
```

## Instance generation

To generate a problem instance we can utilize the `generate_2d_instance`
function.

``` r
library(zav)
library(ggplot2)

instance <- generate_2d_instance(no_of_points = 100)
# plot_point(instance = instance)
ggplot2::ggplot(instance$data) +
    ggplot2::geom_point(ggplot2::aes(x,y,size=`Arrival rate`),
                        shape = 21, fill = alpha("black", .2)) +
    ggplot2::theme_void()
```

## Zoning solutions

### Weighted K-Means

The below code chunk shows how we can utilize the `solve_wkmeans`
function to generate a solution for our problem instance.

``` r
solution_wkm <- solve_wkmeans(instance, no_of_centers = 5, type = "swkm")
plot_bases(solution = solution_wkm)
```

### Genetic Algorithm

The below chunk shows how we can utilize the `solve_ga` function to
generate a solution for our problem instance.

First we need to precalculate centroids to use as input for the GA.

``` r
centroids <- grid_centroids(instance, dimension = 5)
```

Having now the centroids and distances between demand points and
centroids, we are able to give this as input for the GA. As a default
the GA will have a maximum of 10 iterations for demonstration purposes,
in reality we would have a much higher number of iterations.

``` r
solution <- solve_ga(instance, centroids, no_of_centers = 5, obj = "SAFE")
```

``` r
plot_bases(solution)
```

## Simulation

Here it is shown how you can make a simulation based on the solution
just found:

``` r
#' The below line is for testing purposes
#' solution = solution; seed = 1;n_replications = 1;flight = "zoned";max_dist = 1000000;LOS = 600;warmup = 0;speed_agent = .25;verbose = F
simulation_result <- simulation(
  solution = solution_wkm,
  seed = 1,
  n_replications = 1,
  flight = "zoned",
  queue = T,
  max_dist = 1000000,
  LOS = 600,
  warmup = 0,
  speed_agent = .25,
  verbose = F
)
```

``` r
# simulation_result$metrics[[1]]$response_time_performance
```

``` r
simulation_result$metrics[[1]]$distances %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = time, 
             y = distance,
             color = paste0(id1,'-',id2))) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(color = "Pair") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

## Experiment Results

To get analyze the results from the experiment conducted for the project
we do the following.

``` r
results <- experiment_results()
```

The `results` variable is a list of 3 `tibbles` containing information
about instances, solutions and simulations respectively.

### Instances

If we take a look at the instances first we can see that there is a
total of 80 instances. These are distributed across the arrival rate
distributions and arrival rate variances as seen below.

``` r
results$instance |> 
  dplyr::group_by(`Arrival rate distribution`, `Arrival rate variance`) |> 
  dplyr::summarise(n = dplyr::n())
#> # A tibble: 4 x 3
#> # Groups:   Arrival rate distribution [2]
#>   `Arrival rate distribution` `Arrival rate variance`     n
#>   <fct>                       <fct>                   <int>
#> 1 uniform                     low                        20
#> 2 uniform                     high                       20
#> 3 unbalanced                  low                        20
#> 4 unbalanced                  high                       20
```

In the illustration below we can see the difference in arrival rate
distribution between the uniform and unbalanced distribution.

### Solutions

Taking a look at the solutions we see that there are a total of 480
solutions. These are distributed across:

-   `Solution method` that have 3 levels: ga-safe, ga-tot, wkm-swkm.
-   `Number of UAVs` that have 2 levels: high, low.

#### Solution comparsion

If we start by comparing ga-tot and wkm-swkm we see that the latter is
able to outperform the first, with the high number of UAVs.

<img src="man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" width="100%" />

Next we will check the similarity of total arrival rate for uniform and
unbalanced instances.

``` r
results$instance |> 
  dplyr::group_by(`Arrival rate distribution`) |> 
  dplyr::summarise(mean(`Total arrival rate`))
#> # A tibble: 2 x 2
#>   `Arrival rate distribution` `mean(\`Total arrival rate\`)`
#>   <fct>                                                <dbl>
#> 1 uniform                                             0.823 
#> 2 unbalanced                                          0.0953
```

The total arrival rate is not at all the same, so should maybe be
adjusted after looking at the simulation results!

### Simulations
